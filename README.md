# Inverted Pendulum
We made an inverted pendulum for our grammar school project. This included building the inverted pendulum and writing an algorithm to controll the system.

This repository currently contains the code which runs on an ESP-32. Maybe I am going to add more information about the hardware in the future.

Here is a video of the end result:
